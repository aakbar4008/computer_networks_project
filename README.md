Project Implementation

Website Development and Hosting
For this project, I developed a responsive portfolio website using HTML and CSS. I chose Netlify as the hosting platform due to its free hostings and built-in security features. The website includes basic information with a simple layout. I made sure that the site also works on mobile devices with different layouts.

Throughout this project, I implemented several key networking concepts:

Domain Name System (DNS): The website utilizes Netlify's DNS services, which translates the domain name into the corresponding IP address. This demonstrates the practical application of DNS in web hosting.

HTTPS Implementation: Security was implemented through HTTPS protocol, encrypting data transmission between the server and users. This was achieved through Netlify's automatic SSL certificate generation.

IP Addressing: The website is accessible through both its domain name and IP address, showing the relationship between DNS and IP addressing in web networking.

Security Measures
The website incorporates several security features:
- SSL/TLS encryption for secure data transmission
(tested on ssllabs.com/ssltest/)

- Standard web security practices as recommended by Netlify

Challenges and Solutions
During development, I encountered several technical challenges. The primary issue was properly configuring HTTPS, which was resolved by following Netlify's documentation and checking the SSL certificate settings. Additionally, ensuring mobile responsiveness required several iterations of the CSS code. The formatting kept getting messed up whenever I tested it on mobile so I had to find workarounds.

Testing and Verification
The website underwent thorough testing including:
- Cross-browser compatibility testing in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- Mobile responsiveness verification
- SSL security verification through SSL Labs (achieved A rating)

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the practical application of networking concepts learned in class. Through the development process, I gained hands-on experience with web hosting, domain management, and basic security implementation. The resulting website serves as both a functional portfolio and a demonstration of fundamental networking principles.
